> Sam is an extraordinary innovator and entrepreneur, with great experience in start ups and in technology.. His success as an entrepreneur has allowed him to translate his skill set into working on technology from a different perspective, expanding the ecosystem of tech entrepreneurs and bringing their skills to support the use of ICT solutions by civil society organizations to improve their impact. He has shown great flexibility, creativity, and collaboration in our work together. As an outstanding networker, he has pulled a great variety of individuals and organizations into our project, creating many formal partnerships for the project, as well as creating a very positive buzz in the local tech community for the project. He is a breath of fresh air in the development world.

> I've worked alongside Sam in various guises. I've founded four companies and one incorporated society with Sam. I own property with him, have flatted with him, and am Godfather to his daughter. So I feel I'm uniquely qualified to say that he is one of the most innovative people that I know. He has an infectious energy for exploring new ideas, but unlike most 'big ideas' people he actually gets things done. He is also a man of great character and integrity -- he makes me think. I thoroughly enjoy the friendship I share with Sam, and would recommend him to anyone.

> Sam is an ideas-to-action man. He is brilliant at taking an idea and running with it long enough to know if it can fly by itself. Constantly searching for a way to do things better, Sam has what it takes to find out how.
