# Sam creates

I thrive and have a track record in early stage ventures, both commercial and social. 

I co-founded New Zealand's premier user experience company, Optimal Usability and expanded into Australia under Optimal Experience. Both companies have been recently acquired and are now operating as [PriceWaterHouseCoopers][0][Digital][1].

I also started and serve as director of [Optimal Workshop][2], a provider of user experience software that's making life on the Internet easier for millions of people around the world.

In the past few years, I've been privileged to experience the joys and hardship of social ventures and international development. In particular, I worked with the [United Nations Interagency Project][3] on human trafficking to establish [The Mekong Club][4]. I worked on the creation of an impact investment fund  with [Shift360][5] and [Uberis Capital][6]. I believe education in developing countries can be exponentially better in my experiments with [Grit Learning][7]. I created opportunities for others like me to make a difference through the [Good For Nothing Challenge][8]. Most recently, I helped lead and manage a [USAID funded ICT for Development innovation project][9] in Cambodia. 

I am at my best when I work with inspiring people in the fields of technology, design and entrepreneurship for the purposes of a greater good.
