# What I do

I turn ideas into action.

I use [design thinking][0], [internet technology][1] and the principles of business to [solve problems][2] and create new things. I subscribe to [various][3] ways of [getting things done][4], but in reality I've noticed reality is generally messy.

As a deep generalist, I am seldom the technical expert. I work as the facilitator to turn the complex mix of ideas, people, resources and constraints into something real. I cannot guarantee outcomes, but I back my ability to solve problems. 

Sometimes the end result of all this are [businesses][5] or [projects][6]. At other times, it's a [partnership][7] or [ongoing experiments][8]. I finish what I do when it's clear there are [people][9][more suited][10] to [improving on][11][what I've started][12]. 

Over the years, my top strengths have [consistently been identified][13] as: [Strategic][14], [Ideation][15], [Futuristic][16], [Achiever][17] and [Input][18]. These compliment my [entrepreneurial talents][19] that have been described as someone relational with traits of [Disruptor, Selling, Relationship and Knowledge.][20]
