# How I work

## In my work, I must have:

**Great people. **So much enjoyment is tied up with working alongside good people. I only work with people I respect and trust. It helps that we can have fun together.

**Inquisitive minds. **Priority is given to "What if" before "But how" questions. We plan around failure rather than try to eliminate it.

**Autonomy. **I am given the right level of freedom and authority to make decisions. 

**Influence**. Opportunities exist for me to lead and personally make a difference. 

**Purpose.** There is a clear and meaningful direction that improves the lives of a large number of people. I believe whole heartedly in why we're doing what we're doing.

**Tangible results**. I need to be able to trace my efforts to tangible and satisfying results. 

**Flexibility**. I live in rural New Zealand and while I do travel, I intend to work remotely most of the time. 

## It helps to have: 

**A high change environment.** I work better in a fast paced, constantly changing environment that values adaptation over rigid processes.

**Potential for exponential scale.** Everything starts small, but having the fundamentals and ambition of scale in mind inspires me.

Seniority and a contribution to strategy. I would like to think that my experience and ability to see the big picture can contribute to good long term decisions.
