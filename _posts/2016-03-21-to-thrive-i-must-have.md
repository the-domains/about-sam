# What I need

## To thrive, I must have

# **Great people. **So much enjoyment is tied up with working alongside good people. I only work with people I respect and trust. It helps that we can have fun together.

**Inquisitive minds. **Priority is given to "What if" before "But how" questions. We plan around failure rather than try to eliminate it.

**Autonomy. **I am given the right level of trust and authority to turn ideas into action and get things done. 

**Influence**. Opportunities exist for me to lead and personally make a difference. 

**Tangible results**. I need to be able to trace my efforts to tangible and satisfying results. 

**Purpose**. I believe whole heartedly in _why_ we're doing what we're doing. Purpose isn't entirely about social outcomes, but it often includes it.

**Flexibility**. I live in rural New Zealand and while I do travel, I intend to work remotely most of the time. 

## My wish list includes

High change environment. 

Potential for exponential scale.
